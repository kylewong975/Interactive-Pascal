Unity generated Pascal Numbers, featuring color coded numerical patterns and VR extension. This project is made in TreeHacks 2017.

## Authors (ordered by last name)
Shawn Hu - Wrote descriptions of the significance of the highlighted numbers of the Pascal's triangle based on the properties indicated (divisible by [2, 7], diagonals, etc)

Mari Liis Pedak - Suggested this awesome idea to work on, implemented raycasting and menu button movements for VR and programmed some of the logic behind switching between properties

Kyle Wong - Generated the Pascal's Triangle with text displayed as 3D text for a more immersive VR experience, programmed the highlighting mechanisms satisfying given mathematical properties and some of the logic behind switching between properties

## Technologies used
Unity + C# and Samsung Gear VR
